<strong>Welcome to the Furry GIF bot!</strong>

Talk with me directly to save and tag your GIFs. Use me in-line while messaging to search for and send the GIFs you and others have tagged.

<strong>Saving & Tagging</strong>
1. Send me a GIF you'd like to save.
2. Set the content rating (<strong>Safe</strong> or <strong>Mature</strong>).
2. Reply to the GIF with your space-separated list of tags (e.g. <code>hyena brown_fur</code>).
3. To update tags at any time, reply to the GIF again and send any new tags you'd like to add. Prefixing a tag with a <code>-</code> removes that tag from the GIF (e.g. <code>-removed_tag</code>).
<strong>Note:</strong> GIFs must be vetted and approved by a moderator to be searchable.

<strong>Special Tags</strong>
The following tags are reserved. Tagging a GIF with one of the following has special functionality:
• <code>src:</code> — Add a source URL for this GIF. Follow the <code>src:</code> tag with a URL (e.g. <code>src:https://twitter.com/JibKodi/status/1110950264239017984</code>). Multiple sources can be added to the same GIF by using multiple <code>src:</code> tags.
• <code>-src:</code> — Remove the specified source URL for this GIF. Follow the <code>-src:</code> tag with <em>exactly</em> the URL you'd like to remove.

<strong>Commands</strong>
Use these commands when talking directly with me.
/delete — Reply to a GIF with this command to delete it from the GIF library. <strong>Note:</strong> Once approved, only moderators can delete a GIF.
/settings — Update your personal user settings.
/start — View this message, again.

<strong>Searching</strong>
When in a conversation, search for GIFs to send by typing my handle @FurryGIF_bot followed by a space-separated list of tags. Prefix tags you do not want to match with a <code>-</code>. Limit the rating to a specific level by including <code>rating:</code> followed by either <code>safe</code> or <code>explicit</code>.
